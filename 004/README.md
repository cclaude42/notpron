# Look in the dark...

Level 4 shows a view of a bedroom. A clickable circle prompts us for a username and password.

On the nightstand, we can see faint symbols :

```
...- --- --- -.. --- ---
-- .- --. .. -.-.
```

This is morse code. It translates to :

```
VOODOO
MAGIC
```

We can now click the circle, use those words as the username and password (respectively), and move on to level 5.
