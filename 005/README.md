# Light your torch...

`What was the name of that song again?`

Level 5 asks us to find a song. We make sure to include `-notpron` in our internet searches to avoid notpron solutions.

We have two bits of text :

```
BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY

eyes like an angel smiles like a devil
```

A quick Google search tells us the first is the artist's name, and the second a line from the song `Simple Songs`

We click the red button on the remote, use `simple` as username and `songs` as password, and move on to level 6.
