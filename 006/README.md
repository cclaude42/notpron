`an ALTernative?`

Level 6 gives us numbers :

```
108 105 108 107
101 122 111 110
```

Examining the source code, as the page name suggests, reveals :

```html
<!--ascii is an alternative-->
```

Using the ascii table, we decode the numbers :

```
l i l k
e z o n
```

The clickable valve gives us a password hint : `anagram`. We rearrange the letters :

```
k i l l
z o n e
```

We use those as username and password and go to level 7.
